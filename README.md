# OMG! Ubuntu! Android!
A rewritten app for OMG! Ubuntu! on Android, combining the awesomeness of Android and OMG! Ubuntu!'s articles.
## Building
The following prerequisite libraries are required to build the application:

[ActionBarSherlock](https://github.com/JakeWharton/ActionBarSherlock)
[Android v4 Support Library, revision 11](http://developer.android.com/tools/extras/support-library.html)

If these libraries throw any errors, please make sure the OMG! Ubuntu! project and the libraries are built with at Android 4.0+ and Java 1.6+.

The app additionally requires a configuration.xml file that contains query parameters and base urls necessary for the app to function. Please direct enquiries to your local app developer.
